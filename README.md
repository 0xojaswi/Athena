## Introduction

### Athena - a windows based Voice-Cloning System

As we detailed in based on the [main base paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01479) and [website](https://research.myshell.ai/), the advantages of athena are three-fold with the advantage of TTS:

**1. Accurate Tone Color Cloning.**
it tries to accurately clone the reference tone color and generate speech in multiple languages and accents.

**2. Flexible Voice Style Control.
**Athena enables granular control over voice styles, such as emotion and accent, as well as other style parameters including rhythm, pauses, and intonation. 

**3. Zero-shot Cross-lingual Voice Cloning.**
Neither of the language of the generated speech nor the language of the reference speech needs to be presented in the massive-speaker multi-lingual training dataset.

**4. Better Audio Quality.**
Athena adopts a different training strategy that delivers better audio quality, based on VITS.

**5 Native Multi-lingual Support.**
English, Spanish, French, Chinese, Japanese and Korean are natively supported in our project.

**6. FOSS.**
For exploring the field of voice coloning we have made it open-sourced.
